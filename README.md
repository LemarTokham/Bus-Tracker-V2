# Bus Tracker V2
Building an improved bus tracker this time using react/ts and the google maps api

# Current Features
- Currently displays a select number of bus stops.
- Each stop can be clicked on, showing the buses from the selected stop.
- Each bus can be clicked on, once clicked, the location of each bus of that line is displayed on the map

# Features in progress
- Having the bus locations be updated every 10 seconds (which is the same time as which the actual Gov.UK api updates)
- Letting the user know which of the bus options have no buses out on the roads
